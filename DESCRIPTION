Title: Calculate pCO2 via Headspace Equilibration (using He) Method
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Pieter J.K. Aukes
Maintainer: PJKA <paukes@uwaterloo.ca>
Description: This package calculates the pCO2 of a water sample using the headspace equilibrium technique (using helium). This calculation takes into account lab and field temperature, pressure, and salinity (due to preservation).
    All assumptions, calculations, and references used to generate the results can be found in the 'man' folder.
    pCO2 is given in uM, uatm, and %-saturation with respect to atmospheric CO2 at time of sampling.
